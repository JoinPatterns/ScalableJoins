Joins - A Concurrency Library 

Comega promised C# programmers a more pleasant world of concurrent
programming.  Comega had a simple, declarative and powerful model
of concurrency - Join Patterns - applicable both to multithreaded
applications and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based
distributed applications.

By exploiting Generics in the Common Language Runtime, we can now
provide join patterns as a library rather than a language
feature. Offering a library has some advantages: the library is
language neutral, supporting C#, VB and other languages; the library's
join patterns are dynamic, supporting solutions difficult to express
with the static join patterns of Comega.

The Joins library is efficient and has a simple interface that makes
it easy to translate Comega programs to C#. The installer includes a
tutorial, documentation, samples and demos.
